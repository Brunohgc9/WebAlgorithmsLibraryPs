# Algorithm Playground üß™

> Welcome to my personal lab of algorithms: a place where curiosity runs wild, stubbornness refuses shortcuts, and creativity meets brute-force problem-solving.

## About

This repo is my experiment zone for **everything that can be coded**, from the simple to the absurd.  
Sorting? Graphs? Dynamic programming? AI? Optimization? You name it, I break it, understand it, and sometimes fix it.  

Languages I like to torture myself with:  
- **C#**, because structure matters.  
- **C++**, because memory is scary.  
- **Rust**, because ownership is a mood.  
- **Go**, because concurrency is fun‚Ä¶ sometimes.  
- **Python**, occasionally, when I need to feel human.  

**Absolutely no JavaScript**‚Äîlife is too short to argue with `undefined`.

## Structure

I try to organize chaos:

- /Algorithms
- /Sorting
- /Searching
- /Graphs
- /DynamicProgramming
- /Geometry
- /AI
- /Misc


Each folder is a small battlefield. Expect **messy experiments, brutal edge cases, and random notes** explaining what made me rage-quit or what actually worked.

## Rules (aka My Code of Conduct)

- Curiosity > copying: explore before Googling.  
- Persistence > sanity: if it fails, rewrite it differently.  
- Hardcoded lines = temporary surrender to reality.  
- Comment liberally, but sarcasm is encouraged.  
- Every solution must **survive the next week** of my memory (or it gets deleted).  

---

## Goals

- **Own the fundamentals**: algorithms, data structures, patterns.  
- **Experiment without mercy**: brute force, optimization, recursion nightmares.  
- **Learn languages properly**: not just syntax, but paradigms, tricks, and quirks.  
- **Track growth**: every folder is a snapshot of my brain at a moment in time.

## Disclaimer

This is not a curated ‚Äútutorial repo.‚Äù  
If you expect polished, beginner-friendly explanations, you‚Äôre in the wrong lab.  
Here, you‚Äôll see:  

- my thought process,  
- failures turned into experiments,  
- occasional hardcoded ‚Äúlife hacks,‚Äù  
- and a stubborn refusal to simplify just for the sake of looking neat.

> ‚ÄúToo methodical to quit. Too stubborn to simplify.  
> In the end, it still works. Always.‚Äù  

If that resonates, welcome aboard. If not, scroll away.
